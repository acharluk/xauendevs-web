# Setting up the environment

For this tutorials I will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) along with the [C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) and [Easy C++ Projects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ACharLuk.easy-cpp-projects) extensions.

## Downloading Visual Studio Code

First we will need a code editor or IDE, I personally like Visual Studio Code (VSC for short) because it is lightweight like Sublime, but has some of the features I like from IDEs, specially Intellisense. You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you will land on a page like this:

Click the download button and wait a few seconds for the download to start.

## Setting up VSC for C++ development

The first time you open VSC you will see a welcome window. VSC has a very simple layout: a bar on the left with 5 buttons (File explorer, Find, Git integration, Debug, Extensions), a status bar on the bottom and a window with tabs for the editors. Click the last button to open Extensions:

To develop C++ we will install two extensions, the first one is C/C++, which is already shown in the last figure, to install it just click the green button that says `Install`:
![](/programming/C++/images/1/3_cpp_extension_install.png)

Then we will search for "easy c++" and then install the extension called "Easy C++ Projects"

## Environment setup finished

After installing the extensions, a blue button will appear saying `Reload`, clicking it will reload the window and activate the extensions we just installed, as shown here:

Good job! Now we have an environment for depeloping our first C++ project!
